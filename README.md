# Smart-plant-watering-system
The project is about IOT using the appropriate soil moisture sensor for agricultural use. It is created by designing the system with Arduino code and using ESP32+ board.
# Explain:
- Materials
 1. IOXESP32+
 2. 5V solid state relay
 3. Soil Hygrometer Humidity Detection Module  Moisture Water
 Sensor
 4.   Mini Micro Submersible DC 2.5-6V
 5.   Program Arduino

- IOXESP32+
 IOXESP32+ is an ESP32 development board that uses the latest chip
 ESP32 ECO V3. Uses 3.3V power supply 700mA (increased from the normal
 version). Uses FTDI (FT231XQ) to upload programs. Uses USB-C to supply
 power and upload programs. Change the RESET and IO0 switches to be
 easier to press. But it still has the same pin position as the normal IOXESP32
 board and the NodeMCU-32S, Node32 Lite, making it usable with the original
 additional board (Shield) and base (Base).
